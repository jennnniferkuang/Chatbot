So far:
- Machine learning model for some reason
	- Generative, create/display pictures
	- Easy to scale down
- Chatbot
	- Talk to and talk back
	- Save feature, records of chats, transcripts
- Integrated flask
	- But flask might be a little too heavy to run on Pi zero
- app.py display (using tkinter)
	- TO DO: integrate with rest of project
- games and generative ai (pygame)
- continuous listening might not be that feasible(abandon at this time)

To Do:
Jen/Kevin:
- Move stuff from pygame to tkinter
- Keep working on UI
Charlie:
- Integrate chatbot into app.py
Gavin:
- Get the generative images working
- Send images to tkinter
Jiatao:
- Create voices and tones, change variables for expression
- Translations
Raymond:
- Add chatgpt to play chess
