This week:
- Finished text to speech
- Finished speech to text
- Finished send/receive from GPT
    - Get speech file from GPT
- Started setting up simple display using Flask and HTML

Next week:
- Refine existing functions
- Link to raspberry pi
    - Make sure everything can run
    - Connect the parts together
- Focus on UI
    - Customization of prompts/responses
- Store conversation history

Challenges:
- UI is kind of ugly
    - Adding Tailwind for better UX (chat i have no webdev experience)
- Hard finding sufficiently small tts and stt libraries to use on a Pi
- Don't have our Pi yet so can't really check if we can run everything yet
    - might need to cut down on some stuff if the pi can't handle all of it
